# React rolling numbers onscroll

A simple react component

Import:

`import RollingNumbers from "react-rolling-numbers-onscroll"`

Usage:

`<RollingNumbers num={42} millis={3000} />`

- num: Integer to roll up from 0
- millis (optional): milliseconds for animation effect. By default it is 500.
- the animation starts, when the element is in the view.

That's it for now.
